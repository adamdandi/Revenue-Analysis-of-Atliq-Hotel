Conclusions and Recommendations\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe revenue analysis of Atliq Grands hotels shows significant variations in financial performance across different hotels and room classes. The best performing hotel in terms of total revenue is Atliq Seasons, especially in the Elite and Premium room classes. In contrast, Atliq Grands, despite having some room classes with significant revenue, tends to have lower total revenue compared to other hotels such as Atliq Exotica and Atliq Bay. Analysis of average revenue per night shows that the Presidential room class generally has higher revenue than other room classes, both in the flagship hotels and across the network.\n\nIn terms of booking platforms, \"makeyourtrip\" and \"others\" are the two platforms with the largest revenue contribution, indicating customers' preference to use these platforms. Platforms such as \"direct online\" and \"logtrip\" also showed significant revenue contribution but not as much as the two largest platforms.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Focus on Premium and Elite Room Classes:**\n   - Hotels such as Atliq Seasons and Atliq Exotica show excellent revenue in the Elite and Premium room classes. It is recommended to increase offers and promotions for these room classes in underperforming hotels, such as Atliq Grands and Atliq City, to increase appeal and revenue.\n\n2. **Optimisation of Booking Platform:**\n   - With \"makeyourtrip\" and \"others\" being the platforms with the highest revenue, it is important to do more cooperation and promotion through these platforms. Investing more in increasing visibility on these platforms can be profitable.\n\n3. **Strategy Adjustment Based on Average Revenue:**\n   - Although total and average revenue per night vary, hotels should focus on strategies that optimise revenue per night, especially for the Presidential room class which shows high revenue potential. More strategic rate planning and promotions for this class can increase profitability.\n\n4. **Offer Evaluation and Adjustment:**\n   - Conduct an in-depth evaluation of hotels that have lower revenues and consider adjustments in product offerings and pricing. In-depth analysis can help understand why some hotels are not performing as they should and find solutions to increase their revenue.\n\n5. **Improving Customer Experience:**\n   - Given the difference in average revenue per night, it is important to continue investing in customer experience and service quality, especially in lower performing hotels and room classes. Providing better service can help increase customer satisfaction and loyalty, which in turn can increase revenue.\n\nBy implementing these recommendations, Atliq can capitalise on their strengths across different hotels and room classes and increase overall revenue in a more targeted and strategic way.","metadata":{}}]}
